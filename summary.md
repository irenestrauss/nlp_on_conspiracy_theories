## Dataset ##
- check r/conspiracy -> manually, over 2/3 contain direct references to conspiracy theories or contain characteristics of conspiracy theories
- find a control group -> other studies use a group of users that do not interact with r/conspiracy
- idea for control group: mix of different subreddits or popular posts?

## Comments vs Submissions ##
- submissions contain more content, comments probably better for language use

## Statistics ##
- until now just simple analysis with empath -> filter and do not check for all categories
- analyze other-condemned and self-conscious emotions
- analyze pronouns used
- analyze which posts are the most successful
- liwc

## Model ##
- logistic regression
- bigram, trigram
- tfidf
- sentiments
- add grid search
- add more advanced sentiment analysis
- try another approach with deep learning?
