I myself spent a decade in the military as a combat engineer (two deployments to Iraq, 2007-2015 of time in service).  If you see something out of place on the roadway or beside the road do not interact with it. Anti personnel or anti vehicle mines could be in place. If you can see the mine itself, do not go near it. Try to get a description of its size and shape if you can from where you are positioned and relay that information to any Ukrainian military. These mines are extremely devastating to unarmored vehicles and people.",3,57,1645891382.0,57,0,0.87,,https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/t20dd8/combat_engineers_suggestion/

I have not seen any posts about this, but figured I would post here in case it is useful to someone. There seems to be broad support for Ukrainian people in Denmark. There is good healthcare & education here, so the country might be an option for families with such needs, especially those with some English ability - Even if it is a bit far.

t0nx9v,base-4,100% Serious question: Fast-tracked as Ukrainian citizenship to join and serve?,"If 1'000'000 people around the world became bonafide Ukrainian citizens with the sole objective of joining the resistance, perhaps Putin would rethink his war?
  
If the Ukrainian government will have me, I have prior military service with some specialty training. I do not speak any Ukrainian or Russian but am happy to learn.  
  
I understand that my Country will not join the fight, and perhaps that is for the best. This does not stop me (or you) from saying farewell to our loved ones to do what we all know to be the right thing.  
  
Can this be done?  
  
Can we crowd-recruit the Ukraine's defense?  
  
Trust me, I get it ... it takes MONTHS to train people to operate at combat effective levels. You have to start sometime. Somewhere. Somehow.  By Someone.

**(edit):** I was completely unaware of two key facts before posting this. 1. Ukraine does NOT allow dual-citizenship. 2. Being a Ukraine citizen is apparently not a requirement to serve in their armed forces.
